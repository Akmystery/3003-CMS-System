# Crisis-Management-System

The Crisis Management System (CMS) is developed with the aim of being a seamless collaboration between government agencies in times of emergencies. On a graphical web interface, the CMS will provide real-time status updates on a map of Singapore, integrated with weather conditions, dengue hotspot, haze information etc. The CMS will provide useful information such as location of Civil Defence shelters and updates of emergency situations like terrorist activities or accidents within crowded, confined areas to the public through social media periodically. The Prime Ministerâ€™s Office will also receive a status report summarizing key indicators and trends over email every 30 minutes.

When a member of the public reports an incident, the operators of the call centres will input submit the report into the CMS, requests will be updated on the map and dispatched using SMS to relevant agencies.

Thus, key decision makers can monitor the crisis situation through the CMS, allowing the CMS to serve as a command-and-control platform to respond quickly to needs and dangerous conditions, such as gas leaks, hazardous air condition and fires.

FrontEnd is developed using React and BackEnd is developed using Nodejs.
